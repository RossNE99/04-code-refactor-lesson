# Horiseon Marketing Agency 🚀

## Description
This repository contains the source code for the Horiseon Marketing Agency website, which was supplied to us. Our mission was to enhance the webpage's user-friendliness, especially for users that require extra accessability options such as a screen reader or other computer aids.

It's crucial to ensure that everyone, regardless of disability, can easily access and enjoy the internet, we want the internet to be a place where we can all enjoy! Not only that but having all the proper accessability options in place allows us to rank higher on the search engines results pages, that seems pretty important for a company that specialises in search engine optimisation 

 HTML and CSS are the backbone of every webpage, While HTML offers many features, this webpage initially lacked a focus on accessibility. To address this, we've utilized new semantic HTML5 elements and other techniques. Learn more in the [Features](#Features) section.
